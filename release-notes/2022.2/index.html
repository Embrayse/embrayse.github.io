            </header>
            <p>
              Our second major release for 2022 brings with it several process and efficiency improvements. Here is an
              overview:
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="content-container">
            <h2>Food and drink texture overrides</h2>
            <p>
              Residents can now easily choose a different texture for their meals, on a per-order basis. This is
              useful when, for example, a resident likes to have their porridge pureed even though they are on a regular
              diet, or if they are on a minced & moist diet but have a waiver to have a whole pastry. Just like portion
              sizes and notes, texture overrides are remembered as a preference for each menu item so when it is selected
              again in the future, the texture override is automatically applied.
            </p>
            <strong>Safety measures:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the selected texture override is less restrictive than the resident’s default texture,
                an extra confirmation is displayed to your staff.
              </li>
              <li>
                Whenever a resident’s default food or drink texture level is changed by your clinical team, then
                any existing orders and menu item preferences are automatically updated to ensure they do not exceed the
                new texture level.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Quick resident picker</h2>
            <p>
              Collection of orders is now quicker than ever. Using the new resident picker control, you can not only
              select a room number from the dropdown, but using the forward and backward arrows you can jump to the next
              or previous room. Any unoccupied rooms are automatically skipped over.

            <h2>PCS integration enhancements</h2>
            <p>
              Facilities using the PCS integration will now see <strong>Food & Drink Textures</strong>,
              <strong>Allergies</strong>, and <strong>Medical Conditions</strong> automatically synchronised to Embrayse.
              This minimises the need to manually update these fields in Embrayse and ensures the kitchen is up to date
              with residents’ latest dietary information.
            </p>

            <p>
            Note that for medical conditions, the <strong>Medical Summary</strong> field in PCS person profile is
            inspected. Currently, the following information are synchronised from PCS:
            </p>

            <p>
              <div>
                <strong style="display: inline">Food textures:</strong> Pureed (Level 4), Minced and Moist (Level 5), Soft & Bite Sized (Level 6), Regular (Level 7).
              </div>
              <div>
                <strong>Drink thickness:</strong> Thin(Level 0), Slightly Thick(Level 1), Mildly Thick(Level 2), Moderately Thick(Level 3), Extremely Thick(Level 4).
              </div>
              <div>
                <strong>Allergies</strong>: Milk, Fish, Shellfish, Crustacean, Mollusc, Soy, Sesame, Pumpkin, Wheat, Lupin, Sulphite/Sulfite, Egg, Peanut, Tree Nut, Eggplant, Celery.
              </div>
              <div>
                <strong>Medical conditions</strong>: Diabetes, Diverticulosis/Diverticulitis, Crohn’s, Coeliac.
              </div>
            </p>

            <p class="notice">
              IMPORTANT: Because PCS largely utilises free-text fields, the integration is a "best effort" and Embrayse
              cannot guarantee that the information is synchronised 100% of the time. Spelling mistakes or use of
              unrecognised terminology in PCS will cause the information not to come across to Embrayse. If you notice
              any information missing from Embrayse that you believe to be in error, please notify our support team.

            <h2>Away status changes</h2>
            <p>
              Embrayse has always given you the ability to mark a resident as being <em>away</em>. In the past we have hidden
              any orders placed by a resident who is away, from the <strong>Prep report</strong> and printed dockets. We
              have since learnt that sometimes a resident may leave and come back multiple times a day, and we want to ensure
              their orders are not missed. With this update, orders will always show on the <strong>Prep report</strong>
              regardless of the away status. Additionally, we show this status on the report for clarity.
            </p>

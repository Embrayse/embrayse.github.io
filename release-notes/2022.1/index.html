            </header>
            <p>
              It has been a challenging start to 2022 for aged care, with the ever-evolving COVID situation.
              Here at <strong>Embrayse</strong>, we are committed to helping our partners in whatever way possible.
              This first release for the year includes important efficiency and experience improvements for the staff
              and residents, and many more improvements are on our roadmap for the year:
            </p>

          <div class="content-container">
            <h2>Auto-filled resident meal preferences</h2>
            <p>
              It is typical that a resident's preferences for a meal remains unchanged over time. For example if a resident
              prefers a large portion of chicken pasta, or does not want tomatoes in their salad, these choices will
              often be repeated whenever the items are on the menu.
            </p>
            <p>
              Embrayse now remembers these choices, so the portion size and any notes you add to a meal choice will
              automatically be added when a resident picks the same meal in the future. This will provide noticeable
              time savings in order collection, as it reduces the amount of typing required on tablets. It should also
              help improve the accuracy of orders if, for some reason, the resident cannot be asked about their preference.
            </p>
            <p class="notice">
              It is still important for staff to always double-check any notes on a meal choice, as it may no longer be
              relevant.
            </p>

            <h2>Printer settings</h2>
            <p>
              Administrators can now change docket printer settings, including two new settings to change the margins
              at the top and bottom of the dockets. Changing the margins may be helpful in hanging the dockets or
              placing them in trays without the text becoming obscured.
            </p>

            <h2>Updated date picker</h2>
            <p>
              For ease of use and consistency, we have updated the date picker on all screens. They allow you to
              move back and forth using the arrow buttons, or use a calendar to select a date directly.
            </p>
            <p class="notice">
              For iPad users, we recommend upgrading the device operating system to version 15.3 or higher for correct
              functioning of the calendar. Without the upgrade, the date can still be changed using the arrow buttons.

              You can now see the name of the user who has made a change to a resident, in the notifications area. This
              will allow you to follow up with the relevant staff member with any questions or clarifications.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will be looking at making further enhancements to the tracking, to make it clear which fields
              have changed. Stay tuned!
